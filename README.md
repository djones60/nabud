# nabud - A server for the NABU PC

This is a server for the NABU Personal Computer.  For more information about
the NABU PC, please check out [The NABU Network](https://www.nabunetwork.com)
as well as [Adrian Black's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLYjZoShjy0)
about the NABU.

This server is written in C and is intended to be very portable to the
Unix-like systems available today (the various BSDs, Linux, etc.) while
also being as self-contained as possible, relying on no "external" software
packages to build and run.  The majority of the APIs it uses are either
standard C99, standard POSIX, or extremely common extensions, for example
some common BSD APIs that are also available in Linux, such as _syslog(3)_
and _daemon(3)_.

## Features

* Define up to 254 content channels (numbered 1-255) from an arbitrary number
  of sources.
* Sources can be local or remote (such as NabuRetroNet).
* Serve an arbitrary number of NABU PCs:
    * As many RS422 serial ports as you can connect to your system for
      real NABU hardware.
    * Support for connections from NABU emulators (such as MAME) over TCP.
* Decrypt and serve NABU _pak_ files (available from NabuRetroNet).
* Serve your own or others' homebrew NABU binaries (_nabu_ files).
* High-performance; nabud implements a content cache to optimize common
  access patterns and avoid redundant I/O.
* Small footprint; it can run on small machines. The only thing it throws
  memory at is the content cache.
* A control program, nabuctl, that allows a user to easily change the
  channel used by a NABU connection, select programs to load from homebrew
  channels (that vend ".nabu" files), view listings provided by such channels,
  etc.

## Building nabud

nabud uses the GNU autotools-based build system that you're probably already familiar with, as it's used by
many software packages.  Most people will only need to do:

    % ./configure
    % make
    # make install

nabud uses POSIX threads, which must be provided by your system.

In order to handle _pak_ files, a cryptographic library is required; MD5 is
used to generate _pak_ file names and DES is used to decrypt them.  The
following cryptographic libraries are currently supported:

* CommonCrypto (the native API on macOS)
* OpenSSL's _libcrypto_.  This is the native API already provided by many
  Unix-like systems, but you may have to go and install the "development"
  portion of the package in order to get the header files.

In order to download from remote sources, such as NabuRetroNet, an SSL
library is required.  The following SSL libraries are currently supported:

* SecureTransport (the native API on macOS)
* OpenSSL

On Ubuntu, the OpenSSL binaries and shared libraries were installed with
the base system, but the header files were not.  I installed them on my
Ubuntu system like so:

    % sudo apt update
    % sudo apt install libssl-dev

Linux is, of course, extremely fragmented, so if you have some other
distribution, getting OpenSSL installed is left as an exercise for the
reader.  Once it's installed, there is not likely to be any additional
magic that you need to perform; the configure script will probably find it.

The nabuctl program has some basic command line history and editing
support, provided by the _libedit_ library on BSD systems.  A compatible
library may be available on other systems.  I was able to install the
development file for such a library on my Ubuntu system like so:

    % sudo apt update
    % sudo apt install libreadline-dev

Because an effort has been made to keep nabud fairly self-contained and
reliant only on APIs provided by the operating system, building it just
requires a toolchain.  For the BSDs and Linux, it's probably already
installed on your system, but if it's not, then doing so is left as an
exercise for the reader.  For macOS, you will need to install the
[Xcode Developer Tools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
and then launch Xcode to perform the "first launch" task that takes care of
setting up the command-line tools that nabud uses to build.

### Building on Cygwin

Building on Cygwin is a little more complicated.  In addition to the basic
toolchain (gcc-core, binutils, make), you need to ensure you've installed the
libssl-devel and libreadline-devel packages (make sure they match the
versions of the run-time packages that are installed).

## Configuring and running nabud

nabud understands the following command line options:
* _-c conf_ -- specifies an alternate name / location for _nabud.conf_.
  The default location is _$(prefix)/etc/nabud.conf_.
* _-d subsys_ -- enables debugging on the specified subsystem; see the
   nabud(8) man page for details.  This option also implies _-f_.
* _-f_ -- run in the foreground.  Without this, nabud will detach from the
  controlling terminal and run as a daemon.
* _-l logfile_ -- specifies the path to a log file.  Without this option,
  nabud will log to the system log using _syslog(3)_ using the _LOG_USER_
  facility.  Note that when running in the foreground, log messages are always
  sent to the controlling terminal.
* _-u user_ -- Specifies the user that nabud should run as.
* _-U umask_ -- Specifies the file creation mask that nabud should use when
creating files.

On macOS, nabud also understands the following command line options:
* _-L_ -- runs nabud in "launchd mode".  This is similar to the _-f_
  option, but does not change the logging destination.

On Linux, nabud also understands the following command line options:
* _-S_ -- runs nabud in "systemd mode".  This is similar to the _-f_
  option, but does not change the logging destination.

(Astute readers will note that macOS's -L and Linux's -S are the same.)

nabud requires no special permissions; only the ability to open files to be
served to the NABU for reading, and the ability to open the serial ports for
reading and writing.  You can choose to run it as _root_ or as a minimally-
privileged user if you set the permissions on your serial port devices properly.

It is strongly recommended that you run nabud as a minimally-privileged user using
the _-u user_ option.  Typically, you would do this by following these steps:

1. Create a group that will be able to modify any files created by nabud,
   for example _nabu_.
2. Create a user specifically for running nabud, for example _nabu_.  Set
   the default group ID of that user to the group created in step 1.
3. Select a group that will be used to grant permission to open serial ports
   for NABU connections.  Historically, a _dialer_ or _dialout_ group exists
   on some Unix systems for this purpose.  Create one, if necessary.
4. Add the user created in step 2 to the group you selected in step 3.
5. Ensure your serial port devices grant read/write permission to the group
   selected in step 3.
6. Optionally use the _-U umask_ argument to alter the default file creation
   mask so that users in the group created in step 1 can both read and write
   any files created by nabud.

For example, on my NetBSD system, I have the following user and group
configuration for nabud:

    % grep nabu /etc/group
    dialer:*:117:nabu
    nabu:*:2000:thorpej
    
    % grep nabu /etc/passwd
    nabu:*:2000:2000:NABU User:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin
    
    % ls -l /dev/ttyU*
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 0 Dec 31 14:15 /dev/ttyU0
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 1 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU1
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 2 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU2
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 3 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU3
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 4 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU4
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 5 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU5
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 6 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU6
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 7 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU7

To create the nabu group and user on NetBSD or Ubuntu Linux, you can
use the following procedure:

    % sudo groupadd nabu
    % sudo useradd -d /nonexistent -s /sbin/nologin -g nabu -c "NABU User" nabu
    % sudo usermod -G dialer nabu     # NetBSD
      -- or --
    % sudo usermod -G dialout nabu    # Ubuntu

The procedure on other systems is left as an exercise for the reader.

If you plan to serve local files or use any of the storage extensions (either
NHACP or RetroNet), then you will want to create select locations for this
purpose and create the necessary directories.  On my local NABU server, I have
the following directory layout:

    neo2-nas:thorpej 26$ pwd
    /export/nabu
    neo2-nas:thorpej 27$ ls -l 
    channels/  storage/   
    neo2-nas:thorpej 27$ pwd    
    /export/nabu
    neo2-nas:thorpej 28$ ls -l                                                     
    total 8
    4 drwxr-xr-x  6 thorpej  wheel  512 Feb 15 13:46 channels/
    4 drwxr-xr-x  4 thorpej  wheel  512 Feb 15 13:48 storage/
    neo2-nas:thorpej 29$ ls -l channels/                                           
    total 24
    8 drwxr-xr-x  2 thorpej  wheel  7168 Feb  4 10:17 cycle1/
    8 drwxr-xr-x  2 thorpej  wheel  7168 Feb  4 10:21 cycle2/
    4 drwxr-xr-x  2 thorpej  wheel   512 Feb 15 13:36 hacking/
    4 drwxr-xr-x  2 thorpej  wheel   512 Feb 15 13:46 rn-hacking/
    neo2-nas:thorpej 30$ pwd             
    neo2-nas:thorpej 30$ ls -l storage/                                            
    total 8
    4 drwxrwxr-x  2 thorpej  nabu  512 Feb 15 13:48 living-room-nabu/
    4 drwxrwxr-x  2 thorpej  nabu  512 Feb 15 13:48 mame-nabu/
    neo2-nas:thorpej 31$ 

In this example, I have local copies of the original 1984 NABU Network
cycles (that I slurped down from cloud.nabu.ca), plus a couple of additional
local channels for my own hacking purposes.  I've also configured locations
for the NABU to access locally stored files using the storage extensions.

The next step is to set up your nabud configuration file in
_$(prefix)/etc/nabud.conf_.  nabud's configuration is held in a JSON-format
file.  You can start with the example configuration file provided
[here](examples/nabud.conf).  Note that the example has a lot of things
in it that you may not need.  The configuration file is documented in
the nabud(8) man page.

The next step is to install the appropriate start-up "extra" for your
system.  If you are interested in providing extras for your favorite
operating system, please let me know!

### macOS

A launchd plist file for nabud is provided in _$(prefix)/share/nabud/launchd/nabud.plist_.
By default, it runs nabud as the "nabu" user and sets its umask to 002.
Install it and start nabud like so:

    % sudo cp $(prefix)/share/nabud/launchd/nabud.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
    % sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/nabud.plist

### NetBSD and FreeBSD

A start-up script and configuration file are provided in
_$(prefix)/share/nabud/rc.d/nabud_ and
_$(prefix)/share/nabud/rc.conf.d/nabud_.  By default, they run nabud
as the "nabu" user and set its umask to 002.  Install them and run
it like so:

    % sudo cp $(prefix)/share/nabud/rc.d/nabud /etc/rc.d
    % sudo cp $(prefix)/share/nabud/rc.conf.d/nabud /etc/rc.conf.d
    % sudo /etc/rc.d/nabud start

### OpenBSD

A start-up script is provided in _$(prefix)/share/nabud/rc.d/nabud_.
You will need to edit your _/etc/rc.conf.local_ file to specify the
options to pass to nabud.  The recommended settings are:

    nabud_flags="-u nabu -U 002"

Next, edit your _/etc/rc.conf_ file to add nabud to the "pkg_scripts"
variable.  Then copy the start-up script into place and run it:

    % sudo cp $(prefix)/share/nabud/rc.d/nabud /etc/rc.d
    % sudo /etc/rc.d/nabud start

### Linux (systemd)

A systemd service file is provided in
_$(prefix)/share/nabud/systemd/nabud.service_.  By default, it runs
nabud as the "nabu" user and sets its umask to 002.  Install it and
run it like so:

    % sudo cp $(prefix)/share/nabud/systemd/nabud.service /lib/systemd/system
    % sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    % sudo systemctl enable nabud.service
    % sudo systemctl start nabud.service

## Controlling nabud with nabuctl

A control program, nabuctl, is provided that allows you to interact with
nabud to change channels, list connections, display channel listings, etc.
nabuctl must be run on the same system where nabud is running.

Upon start-up, nabuctl does a handshake with the server to ensure they're
the same version:

    % nabuctl
    Server version: 1.1
    nabuctl> 

There is some basic help available:

    nabuctl> ?
    Available commands:
            exit
            quit
            help
            ?
            channel
            connection
            list
            show
    nabuctl> 

You can list the channels available, as well as any current connections:

    nabuctl> list channels
    1  - NABU Network 1984 Cycle v1 (NabuRetroNet)
    2  - NABU Network 1984 Cycle v2 (NabuRetroNet)
    3  - DJs Playground Cycle       (NabuRetroNet)
    9  - HomeBrew                   (NabuRetroNet)
    11 - NABU Network 1984 Cycle v1 (Local)

    14 - Listener [19] IPv6-5019
    15 - Listener [19] IPv4-5019
    nabuctl> 

You can change channels:

    nabuctl> connection 1 channel 9
    /dev/tty-uftdi-A10MHWD6-0: Selecting channel 'HomeBrew' on NabuRetroNet.
    nabuctl> 

Additional details for channels and connections can also be viewed:

    nabuctl> show channel 9
    Channel 9:
            Name: HomeBrew
          Source: NabuRetroNet
            Path: https://cloud.nabu.ca/HomeBrew/titles
            Type: NABU
     Listing URL: https://cloud.nabu.ca/HomeBrew/titles/filesv2.txt
        RetroNet: enabled
    nabuctl> show connection 1
    Connection 1:

          Channel: 9
     Storage area: /home/nabu/storage/living-room-nabu
         RetroNet: enabled
    nabuctl> 

You can see the list of files available on a connections' channel, if
that channel provides a listing:

## Changes

### nabud-1.2
* Added command history to nabuctl on systems that have the BSD
  _libedit_ library and on other systems that have a compatible
  library.
* Added a Baud configuration property to Connection objects.  This allows
  users who have modified their NABU to use a different HCCA baud rate
  clock to specify the baud rate to use.
* Renamed the FileRoot property on Connection objects to StorageArea,
  as the old name could be confusing.  The old name is still accepted for
  compatibility with existing configuration files.
* Changed nabud's -d flag to enable debugging on specific subsystems,
  reducing the amount of logs you have to sift through when trying to
  figure out a problem.
* Added "show all channels" and "show all connections" commands to
  nabuctl, which shows the details for all channels and connections,
  respectively, rather than just one at a time.
* Added a systemd extra for Linux, along with some other Linux-specific
  instructions, provided by sampson on Discord.
* Added Docker support, provided by Christopher Masto.

### nabud-1.1.1
* Fix an issue reported by jefferystone on Discord -- if you selected a
  file on a "Listener" connection using nabuctl, it would not be properly
  inherited when the real TCP connection came in from an emulator.
* Fix some typos / spelling errors in the document you're reading now.
  Patch provided by cml37.  Thanks!

### nabud-1.1
* Tweaks to image cache management: images from local sources are cached
  less aggressively.  This reduces the memory footprint of nabud at very
  little cost to overall performance, and also makes local NABU program
  development a bit easier as there is no need to manually clear the cache
  each time a new image is dropped into a local channel being used for
  that purpose.
* Added support for NabuRetroNet protocol extensions version _v2023.02.03.00_.
  This enables running the NabuRetroNet Cloud CP/M.
* Updated the example _nabud.conf_ file to show storage and RetroNet
  options.

### nabud-1.0
* Added support for the NABU HCCA Application Communication Protocol.  This
  protocol is much better specified than the NabuRetroNet protocol (which
  doesn't even really have a specification) and is more easily extensible
  to provide other services besides storage (for example, network connection
  proxy, etc.).  Information about NHACP can be found
  [here](https://github.com/hanshuebner/nabu-figforth/blob/main/nabu-comms.md).
* Added _rc.d_ and _rc.conf.d_ extras for FreeBSD.
* Added an _rc.d_ extra for OpenBSD.
* Added a launchd plist extra for macOS.
* Another change for Linux's over-restrictive cfsetspeed(3).  Thanks to
  tatokis for pointing it out and confirming the fix.
* Man pages for nabud(8) and nabuctl(1).

### nabud-0.9.1
* Fixed a problem with Linux's overly-restrictive cfsetspeed(3) whereby
  attempting to set the native NABU baud rate would cause the entire serial
  port setup to fail rather then falling back to 115.2K baud.

### nabud-0.9
* Added _rc.d_ and _rc.conf.d_ extras for NetBSD and a few other tweaks
  to make it ready for pkgsrc.
* Updated example config in preparation for additional NabuRetroNet channels.
* Fixed the time packet to properly report the day of the week.

### nabud-0.8
* Experimental for the NabuRetroNet blob store extensions to the Adaptor
  protocol.  These extensions allow programs running on the NABU to access
  up to 256 "slots" of cloud storage that are cached in the server.  This
  opens up a lot of exciting opportunities for things like downloadable game
  levels, music tracks, etc.  This work is currently unfinished, and is
  provided only as a preview.
* nabud now builds on Linux (built and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
* Added _-u user_ and _-U umask_ options for easily running nabud as a
  minimally-privileged user.
* Added nabuctl, a program for sending control messages to nabud.  This
  allows you to easily change the channel used by individual NABU connections,
  and list and select programs to run from the NabuRetroNet _HomeBrew_ channel.

### nabud-0.7.1
* Fix a compiler warning that was happening with some versions of Xcode on
  macOS.

### nabud-0.7
* Support for remote sources, including NabuRetroNet, althrough
  NabuRetroNet's "HomeBrew" channel does not work due to how the data
  is vended by that channel.
* Support for SecureTransport on macOS, eliminating the dependency on
  OpenSSL on that platform.

### nabud-0.6
* Added TCP connection support, for emulators such as MAME.
* Changed the build system to use GNU autotools.
* Several small bug fixes.

### nabud-0.5
This was the initial "preview" release, just meant to get it out there for
folks to play with.  It supported only local sources and serial connections.
Written over the course of a few days during the Christmas 2022 holiday break.

  [NABU Network Reconstruction Project](https://museum.eecs.yorku.ca/nabu),
  which has been working with these machines for many years now, and has
  been super gracious even while being bombarded with requests for information.

I also want to acknowledge some people whose code I have borrowed or used
as a reference for this project:
* Nick Daniels' [NabuNetworkEmulator](https://github.com/GryBsh/NabuNetworkEmulator)
  served as a reference for the NABU Adaptor protocol.  The files _nabu_proto.h_
  and _adaptor.c_ were partially derived from his work.
* David Kuder's [nabu-tftp](https://github.com/dkgrizzly/nabu-tftp) gateway
  for the Raspberry Pi Pico also served to clarify some bits of the Adaptor
  protocol.
* Alistair Crooks' "Minimal JSON" (_libmj_) was used to build the
  configuration file parser.
* The _fetch_ library (_libfetch_) was written by primarily by Dag-Erling
  Smørgrav, with additional contributions by Joerg Sonnenberger and
  Thomas Klausner.  The version here comes from The NetBSD Project.
* [The NetBSD Project](https://www.netbsd.org) is where the file _nbsd_queue.h_
  comes from.  _<sys/queue.h>_ from BSD is one of the handiest system header
  files in existence and I wish it were available everywhere.
