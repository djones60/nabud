# nabud - A server for the NABU PC

This is a server for the NABU Personal Computer.  For more information about the NABU PC,
please check out [NabuRetroNet](https://nabu.ca) as well as
[Adrian Black's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLYjZoShjy0) about the NABU.

This server is written in C and is intended to be very portable to the Unix-like systems
available today (the various BSDs, Linux, etc.) while also being as self-contained as
possible, relying on no "external" software packages to build and run.  The majority of
the APIs it uses are either standard C99, standard POSIX, or extremely common extensions,
for example some common BSD APIs that are also available in Linux, such as _syslog(3)_
and _daemon(3)_.

## Features

* Define up to 254 content channels (numbered 1-255) from an arbitrary number of sources.
* Sources can be local or remote (such as NabuRetroNet).
* Serve an arbitrary number of NABU PCs:
    * As many RS422 serial ports as you can connect to your system for real NABU hardware.
    * Support for connections from NABU emulators (such as MAME) over TCP.
* Decrypt and serve NABU _pak_ files (available from NabuRetroNet).
* Serve your own or others' homebrew NABU binaries (_nabu_ files).
* High-performance; nabud implements a content cache to optimize common access patterns and avoid redundant I/O.
* Small footprint; it can run on small machines. The only thing it throws memory at is the content cache.
* A control program, nabuctl, that allows a user to easily change the channel used by a NABU
connection, select programs to load from homebrew channels (that vend ".nabu" files), view listings provided
by such channels, etc.

## Configuration

nabud's configuration is held in a JSON-format configuration file.  This configuration file
must contain 3 stanzas, in the following order:

* Sources: an array of content sources.  Sources provide the content that is served by Channels.
* Channels: an array of content channels.  Connections get their content from Channels.  Each
Channel can be served by any source.
* Connections: an array of connections.

### Sources

Each Source has 3 properies:
* Name: a string that idenfies the source.  It's meant both for human consumption
as well as for specifying which Source provides a Channel.
* Location: a local path or a URL string that specifies the root of the source.

### Channels

Each Channel has 4 mandatory properites and 3 optional properties:
* Name: a string that identifies a Channel.  It's meant both for human consumption, but
also specifies the name of the directory in the Source's location that contains the Channel's
files.
* Path: an optional string that overrides the default directory for the Channel's content.
* ListURL: on optional string that specifes the URL for the Channel's file listing.
* DefaultFile: an optional string that specifies the default file to serve when the
NABU requests image 000001.  This is used only if the Connection has not specified a
selected file.
* Number: a unique number from 1 to 255 that identifies the Channel to the NABU.
* Type: a string that specifies the type of files provided by the Channel:
    * pak: NABU _pak_ files (content that is pre-wrapped in packet headers).  These
    are the original NABU Network files and can be downloaded from NabuRetroNet.
    * nabu: Raw _nabu_ binary files, such as those you build yourself.  nabud packetizes
    these files on-the-fly.
* Source: a string that specifies the Source that provides the Channel.

### Connections

Each Connection has 3 properties:
* Type: a string that specifies the type of connection:
    * serial: an RS422 serial connection to real NABU hardware.
    * tcp: a TCP listener that accepts connections from emulators (e.g. MAME).
* Port: a string that specifies the "port" to use for the connection, which varies
based on the connection type:
    * serial: a string that specifies the path to the serial port to use for the connection.
    * tcp: a string that specifies the TCP port on which connections will be accepted.
* Channel: a numnber from 1 to 255 that specifies which channel to use for this connection.

### Example configuration file

This is the _nabud.conf_ configuration file I use to serve my own NABU:

## Building nabud

nabud uses the GNU autotools-based build system that you're probably already familiar with, as it's used by
many software packages.  Most people will only need to do:

    % ./configure
    % make
    # make install

nabud uses POSIX threads, which must be provided by your system.

In order to handle _pak_ files, a cryptographic library is required; MD5 is used to generate _pak_ file names
and DES is used to decrypt them.  The following cryptographic libraries are currently supported:

* CommonCrypto (the native API on macOS)
* OpenSSL's _libcrypto_.  This is the native API already provided by many Unix-like systems, but you may
have to go and install the "development" portion of the package in order to get the header files.

In order to download from remote sources, such as NabuRetroNet, an SSL library is required.  The following
SSL libraries are currently supported:

* SecureTransport (the native API on macOS)
* OpenSSL

On Ubuntu, the OpenSSL binaries and shared libraries were installed with the base system, but the header
files were not.  I installed them on my Ubuntu system like so:

    % sudo apt update
    % sudo apt install libssl-dev

Linux is, of course, extremely fragmented, so if you have some other distribution, getting OpenSSL installed
is left as an exercise for the reader.  Once it's installed, there is not likely to be any additional magic
that you need to perform; the configure script will probably find it.

Because an effort has been made to keep nabud fairly self-contained and reliant only on APIs provided by
the operating system, building it just requires a toolchain.  For the BSDs and Linux, it's probably already
installed on your system, but if it's not, then doing so is left as an exercise for the reader.  For macOS,
you will need to install the [Xcode Developer Tools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) and
then launch Xcode to perform the "first launch" task that takes care of setting up the command-line tools
that nabud uses to build.

## Running nabud

After building nabud, copy the example _nabud.conf_ to the selected location (default: _/etc/nabud.conf_), tailor
it to your system, and then run it:

    # ./nabud

nabud requires no special permissions; only the ability to open files to be served to the NABU for reading,
and the ability to open the serial ports for reading and writing.  You can choose to run it as _root_ or as
an unprivileged user if you set the permissions on your serial port devices properly.  If you're only using
TCP functionality, it can run completely unprivileged.

nabud understands the following command line options:
* _-c conf_ -- specifies an alternate name / location for _nabud.conf_.
* _-d_ -- enables debugging.  This option also implies _-f_.
* _-f_ -- run in the foreground.  Without this, nabud will detach from the controlling terminal and run as a daemon.
* _-l logfile_ -- specifies the path to a log file.  Without this option, nabud will log to the system log using _syslog(3)_
using the _LOG_USER_ facility.  Note that when running in the foreground, log messages are always sent to the
controlling terminal.
* _-u user_ -- Specifies the user that nabud should run as.
* _-U umask_ -- Specifies the file creation mask that nabud should use when creating files.

In addition to errors, nabud logs some basic information about the requests it servies.  Here is a system log snippet
showing the messages you will typically see:

It is recommended that you run nabud as a minimally-privileged user using the _-u user_ option.  Typically, you would do this by
following these steps:
1. Create a group that will be able to modify any files created by nabud, for example _nabu_.
2. Create a user specifically for running nabud, for example _nabu_.  Set the default group ID
of that user to the group created in step 1.
3. Select a group that will be used to grant permission to open serial ports for NABU connections.
Historitcally, a _dialer_ group exists on some Unix systems for this purpose.  Create one, if necessary.
4. Add the user created in step 2 to the group you selected in step 3.
5. Ensure your serial port devices grant read/write permission to the group selected in step 3.
6. Optionally use the _-U umask_ argument to alter the default file creation mask so that users
in the group created in step 1 can both read and write any files created by nabud.

For example, on my NetBSD system, I have the following user and group configuration for nabud:

    % grep nabu /etc/group
    dialer:*:117:nabu
    nabu:*:2000:thorpej
    
    % grep nabu /etc/passwd
    nabu:*:2000:2000:NABU User:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin
    
    % ls -l /dev/ttyU*
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 0 Dec 31 14:15 /dev/ttyU0
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 1 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU1
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 2 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU2
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 3 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU3
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 4 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU4
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 5 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU5
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 6 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU6
    0 crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer  66, 7 May 19  2021 /dev/ttyU7
    
    # ./nabud -u nabu -U 002

## Extras for your operating system

nabud comes with some extras that help with integration onto operating systems on which it runs.

* NetBSD - An _rc.d_ script and an _rc.conf.d_ configuration file are installed into $(prefix)/share.
Tweak them to your liking and copy them into _/etc/rc.d_ and _/etc/rc.conf.d_.

If you are interested in providing extras for your favorite operating system, please let me know!

## Controlling nabud with nabuctl

A control program, nabuctl, is provided that allows you to interact with nabud to change channels,
list connections, display channel listings, etc.  nabuctl must be run on the same system where
nabud is running.

Upon start-up, nabuctl does a handshake with the server to ensure they're the same version:

    % nabuctl
    Server version: 0.8
    nabuctl> 

There is some basic help available:

    nabuctl> ?
    Available commands:
            exit
            quit
            help
            ?
            channel
            connection
            list
            show
    nabuctl> 

You can list the channels available, as well as any current connections:

    nabuctl> list channels
    1  - NABU Network 1984 Cycle v1 (NabuRetroNet)
    2  - NABU Network 1984 Cycle v2 (NabuRetroNet)
    3  - HomeBrew                   (NabuRetroNet)
    11 - cycle1                     (Local)
    12 - homebrew                   (Local)
    nabuctl> list connections
    1  - Serial   [1]  /dev/tty-uftdi-A10MHWD6-0
    2  - Listener [1]  IPv6-5001
    3  - Listener [1]  IPv4-5001
    4  - Listener [2]  IPv6-5002
    5  - Listener [2]  IPv4-5002
    6  - Listener [3]  IPv6-5003
    7  - Listener [3]  IPv4-5003
    8  - Listener [11] IPv6-5011
    9  - Listener [11] IPv4-5011
    10 - Listener [12] IPv6-5012
    11 - Listener [12] IPv4-5012
    nabuctl> 

Additional details for channels and connections can also be viewed:

    nabuctl> show channel 3
    Channel 3:
            Name: HomeBrew
          Source: NabuRetroNet
            Path: https://cloud.nabu.ca/HomeBrew/titles
            Type: NABU
     Listing URL: https://cloud.nabu.ca/HomeBrew/titles/files.txt
    nabuctl> show connection 1
    Connection 1:
             Name: /dev/tty-uftdi-A10MHWD6-0
             Type: Serial
            State: OK
          Channel: 1
    nabuctl> 

You can change channels:

    nabuctl> connection 1 channel 3
    /dev/tty-uftdi-A10MHWD6-0: Selecting channel 'HomeBrew' on NabuRetroNet.
    nabuctl> 

You can see the list of files available on a connections's channel, if that channel provides a listing:

## Changes

### nabud-0.9.1
* Fixed a problem with Linux's overly-restrictive cfsetspeed(3) whereby attempting
to set the native NABU baud rate would cause the entire serial port setup to fail rather
then falling back to 115.2K baud.

### nabud-0.9
* Added _rc.d_ and _rc.conf.d_ extras for NetBSD and a few other tweaks to make it ready for pkgsrc.
* Updated example config in preparation for additional NabuRetroNet channels.
* Fixed the time packet to properly report the day of the week.

### nabud-0.8
* Experimental for the NabuRetroNet blob store extensions to the Adaptor protocol.  These extensions
allow programs running on the NABU to access up to 256 "slots" of cloud storage that are cached
in the server.  This opens up a lot of exciting opportunities for things like downloadable game
levels, music tracks, etc.  This work is currently unfinished, and is provided only as a preview.
* nabud now builds on Linux (built and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
* Added _-u user_ and _-U umask_ options for easily running nabud as a minimally-privileged user.
* Added nabuctl, a program for sending control messages to nabud.  This allows you to easily change
the channel used by individual NABU connections, and list and select programs to run from the
NabuRetroNet _HomeBrew_ channel.

### nabud-0.7.1
* Fix a compiler warning that was happening with some versions of Xcode on macOS.

### nabud-0.7
* Support for remote sources, including NabuRetroNet, althrough NabuRetroNet's "HomeBrew"
channel does not work due to how the data is vended by that channel.
* Support for SecureTransport on macOS, eliminating the dependency on OpenSSL on that platform.

### nabud-0.6
* Added TCP connection support, for emulators such as MAME.
* Changed the build system to use GNU autotools.
* Several small bug fixes.

### nabud-0.5
This was the initial "preview" release, just meant to get it out there for folks to play with.
It supported only local sources and serial connections.  Written over the course of a few days
during the Christmas 2022 holiday break.

## Acknowledgements

First off, I want to acknowledge the folks nominally responsible for this NABU "Great Awakening":
* Adrian Black and his [Adrian's Digital Basement](https://www.youtube.com/@adriansdigitalbasement)
YouTube channel. I'm a Patreon patron of this channel and the early-access to Adrian's NABU video
is how I first learned of these cool machines.  I think it's fair to say that Adrian's video is
what spurred the recent interest in these machines.
* DJ Sures (his YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@DJSures)) who has some family history
with the NABU and did a bunch of reverse engineering on the Adaptor protocol and has led the charge
on the NabuRetroNet.
* Leo Binkowski (his YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@leo.binkowski)), a former NABU
engineer who preserved a TON of stuff when the NABU company folded.
* The York University Computer Museum's [NABU Network Reconstruction Project](https://museum.eecs.yorku.ca/nabu),
which has been working with these machines for many years now, and has been super gracious
even while being bombarded with requests for information.

I also want to acknowledge some people whose code I have borrowed or used as a reference for this project:
* Nick Daniels' [NabuNetworkEmulator](https://github.com/GryBsh/NabuNetworkEmulator) served as a reference
for the NABU Adaptor protocol.  The files _nabu_proto.h_ and _adaptor.c_ were partially derived from his work.
* David Kuder's [nabu-tftp](https://github.com/dkgrizzly/nabu-tftp) gateway for the Raspberry Pi Pico
also served to clarify some bits of the Adaptor protocol.
* Alistair Crooks' "Minimal JSON" (_libmj_) was used to build the configuraiton file parser.
* The _fetch_ library (_libfetch_) was written by primarily by Dag-Erling Smørgrav, with additional
contributions by Joerg Sonnenberger and Thomas Klausner.  The version here comes from The NetBSD Project.
* [The NetBSD Project](https://www.netbsd.org) is where the file _nbsd_queue.h_ comes from.  _<sys/queue.h>_ from BSD
is one of the handiest system header files in existence and I wish it were available everywhere.
